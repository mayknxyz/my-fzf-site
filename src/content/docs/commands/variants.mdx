## Pattern

```
f + {scope} + {action} + {variant}
```

Variants are appended as suffixes to any scoped command.

## Variant Suffixes

|--------|---------|-------------|
| `-h` | Include hidden files (dotfiles) | `--hidden` |
| `-ni` | No gitignore (show ignored files) | `--no-ignore` |
| `-hni` | Both hidden and no-ignore | `--hidden --no-ignore` |
