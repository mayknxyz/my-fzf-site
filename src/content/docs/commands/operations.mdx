title: File Operations
description: 24 commands for removing, moving, copying, and renaming files and directories.

## Pattern

```
f + {scope} + {operation} + {type}
```

Where `{type}` is `f` (file) or `d` (directory).

## Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `rm` | Remove (delete) |
| `mv` | Move to a different location |
| `cp` | Copy to a different location |
| `rn` | Rename in place |

## Command Table

| Operation | cwd (`c`) | repo (`r`) | global (`g`) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| Remove file | `fcrmf` | `frrmf` | `fgrmf` |
| Remove directory | `fcrmd` | `frrmd` | `fgrmd` |
| Move file | `fcmvf` | `frmvf` | `fgmvf` |
| Move directory | `fcmvd` | `frmvd` | `fgmvd` |
| Copy file | `fccpf` | `frcpf` | `fgcpf` |
| Copy directory | `fccpd` | `frcpd` | `fgcpd` |
| Rename file | `fcrnf` | `frrnf` | `fgrnf` |
| Rename directory | `fcrnd` | `frrnd` | `fgrnd` |

## Extension-Filtered Operations

File operations also support extension suffixes for file types (not directories):

```bash
fcrmfmd     # remove markdown file in cwd
frcpfjs     # copy JavaScript file in repo
fgmvfts     # move TypeScript file globally
fcrnfsh     # rename shell script in cwd
```

See [Extension-Filtered Commands](/commands/extensions/) for the full list of supported extensions.

## Total Count

3 scopes × 8 operations (4 operations × 2 types) = **24 file operation commands**

Plus 3 scopes × 10 extensions × 4 file operations = **120 extension-filtered operation commands** (included in the extension total).
