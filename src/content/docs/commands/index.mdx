## Command Count Breakdown

my-fzf generates **334 commands** through composable naming:

| Category | Formula | Count |
|----------|---------|-------|
| [Core](/commands/core/) | 3 standalone commands | **3** |
| [Scoped](/commands/scoped/) | 3 scopes × 8 actions | **24** |
| [Variants](/commands/variants/) | 3 scopes × 3 variants × 8 actions | **72** |
| [Extensions](/commands/extensions/) | 3 scopes × 10 extensions × 7 actions | **210** |
| [File Operations](/commands/operations/) | 3 scopes × 8 operations | **24** |
| Help | `fzf-help` / `f-help` | **1** |
| **Total** | | **334** |

<Aside type="note">
  The exact count depends on optional dependencies. If `nvim` is not installed, commands using `n` and `gn` actions are skipped, reducing the total.

## How Commands Are Generated

Commands are not handwritten — they are generated at shell startup by nested `for` loops using `eval`. This means:

- All commands follow the same naming convention
- Adding a new scope or extension automatically creates all matching commands
- The source code stays compact despite generating 334 functions

## Finding Commands

Use the built-in help browser to search and inspect any command:

```bash
fzf-help    # or f-help — browse all loaded commands
```

This opens fzf with every my-fzf function listed. Select one to see its definition.
