title: Scoped Commands
description: 24 commands for finding, navigating, grepping, and previewing across 3 scopes.
---

## Pattern

```
f + {scope} + {action}
```

Where `{scope}` is `c` (cwd), `r` (repo root), or `g` (global/home).

## Command Table

| Action | cwd (`c`) | repo (`r`) | global (`g`) | Description |
|--------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Find file | `fcf` | `frf` | `fgf` | Select a file with fzf |
| Find directory | `fcd` | `frd` | `fgd` | Select a directory with fzf |
| Open in nvim | `fcn` | `frn` | `fgn` | Find and open in nvim |
| Preview with bat | `fcb` | `frb` | `fgb` | Find and preview with bat |
| cd with zoxide | `fcz` | `frz` | `fgz` | Smart cd with zoxide |
| Grep | `fcg` | `frg` | `fgg` | Search content with rg + fzf |
| Grep + bat | `fcgb` | `frgb` | `fggb` | Grep and preview match with bat |
| Grep + nvim | `fcgn` | `frgn` | `fggn` | Grep and open match in nvim |

## How Scopes Work

- **`c` (cwd)** — Searches from the current working directory (`.`)
- **`r` (repo)** — Searches from the git repository root. Falls back to `.` if not inside a git repo
- **`g` (global)** — Searches from `$HOME`

The scope is resolved at runtime by the `_fscope` helper:

```bash
_fscope() { case $1 in c) echo .;; r) _frroot;; g) echo "$HOME";; esac; }
```
