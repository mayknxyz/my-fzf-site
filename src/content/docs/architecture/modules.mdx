## Module Load Order

Modules are sourced in strict order. Each module depends on helpers and prior modules.

| Order | Module | Commands | Description |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `lib/core.sh` | 3 | Standalone commands: `fh`, `fkp`, `fbr` |
| 2 | `lib/scoped.sh` | 24 | Scoped find/navigate/grep across 3 scopes × 8 actions |
| 3 | `lib/variants.sh` | 72 | Hidden/no-ignore variants across 3 scopes × 3 variants × 8 actions |
| 4 | `lib/ext.sh` | 210 | Extension-filtered commands across 3 scopes × 10 extensions × 7 actions |
| 5 | `lib/ops.sh` | 24 | File operations across 3 scopes × 8 operations |
| 6 | `lib/help.sh` | 1 | `fzf-help` / `f-help` command browser |

<Aside type="caution">
  Module load order matters. All modules depend on the helpers (`_fscope`, `_fext`) defined in `my-fzf.sh`. Changing the order may break command generation.
</Aside>

## lib/core.sh

Defines 3 standalone commands that don't follow the scope pattern:

- `fh` — History search and execute
- `fkp` — Kill process
- `fbr` — Git branch checkout

## lib/scoped.sh

Generates scoped commands using a `for` loop over scopes (`c`, `r`, `g`) and actions:

- Find file/directory (`f`, `d`)
- Open in nvim (`n`), preview with bat (`b`), cd with zoxide (`z`)
- Grep (`g`), grep + bat (`gb`), grep + nvim (`gn`)

## lib/variants.sh

Extends scoped commands with hidden/no-ignore variants:

- `-h` adds `--hidden` flag to fd/rg
- `-ni` adds `--no-ignore` flag
- `-hni` adds both flags

## lib/ext.sh

Generates extension-filtered commands by looping over the `_fext` associative array. Each extension gets find, nvim, bat, and operation commands.

## lib/ops.sh

Generates file operation commands (remove, move, copy, rename) for files and directories across all scopes.

## lib/help.sh

Defines the `fzf-help` (aliased as `f-help`) command that lists all loaded my-fzf functions using `declare -F` and lets you inspect their definitions.
