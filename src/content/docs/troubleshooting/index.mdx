## Common Issues

### "required dependency 'X' not found — aborting"

my-fzf requires fzf, fd, rg, bat, and zoxide. If any are missing, it aborts entirely.

**Fix:** Install the missing dependency. See [Dependencies](/dependencies/) for install commands.

### Commands not found after installation

The most common cause is not reloading your shell.

**Fix:** Run `source ~/.bashrc` or open a new terminal.

### "optional dependency 'nvim' not found — related commands skipped"

This is a warning, not an error. my-fzf loaded successfully but skipped `n` and `gn` commands.

**Fix:** Install <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neovim</a> if you want editor integration, or ignore the warning.

### `frf` searches from wrong directory

The `r` (repo) scope uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find the repository root. If you're not inside a git repository, it falls back to the current directory.

**Fix:** Make sure you're inside a git repository, or use `fc*` (cwd) or `fg*` (global) commands instead.

### fzf opens but shows no results

This usually means `fd` found no matching files in the search scope.

**Fix:**
- Check that files exist in the expected directory
- Try a broader scope (e.g., `frf` instead of `fcf`)
- Try a variant with hidden/ignored files (e.g., `fcf-h` or `fcf-hni`)

### Extension command finds no files

Extension-filtered commands only match specific file extensions. For example, `fcfts` only finds `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, and `.cts` files.

**Fix:** Check that files with the expected extension exist in the search scope. Use `fcf` (unfiltered) to verify.

### `zoxide` commands don't work

zoxide needs to be initialized in your shell before my-fzf loads.

**Fix:** Make sure `eval "$(zoxide init bash)"` appears in your `.bashrc` **before** the `source ~/my-fzf/my-fzf.sh` line.

## Verifying Installation

Run this command to check that my-fzf loaded correctly:

```bash
declare -F | grep "^declare -f f[crg]\|^declare -f f[hkb]" | wc -l
```

You should see a count around 330. The exact number depends on whether optional dependencies are installed.

## Getting Help

- Browse all commands: `fzf-help` or `f-help`
- Check a specific command: `type fcf` (shows the function definition)
